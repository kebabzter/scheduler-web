# Info

This app is a direct translation of my python cli **[week-scheduler](https://github.com/kebabzter/week-scheduler.git)**

This version is created for the web so that it can be easily accessible on a mobile device.
It is also upgraded and allows for changing of your **"goal"** and **work days**.

## How to

### Installation

Unfortunately the only way for you to use it is to download/clone the repo.

Once that is done you have to run 

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Usage

1. You add the lectures that you have for the chosen day.
2. You check whether or not you have completed all your uni work
    - If you have the app will make sure to use free time during the day for your main goal.
    - If you have not the app will prioritize uni work to use free time during the day.

### Settings

The app has a few settings you can currently change

  - Which days you work
  - What your goal is 
  >(in my case studying math)
  - What is the main priority 
  >(in my case uni work)

As of the current version the time spots for work can not be changed. sry lol

### Final notes
Currently the app is only hosted for myself because so far I am the only one who plans on using it lol.

If there is further interest in the app I may be interested in hosting it for the public

Also feel free to PR if you would like to make an addition/improvement to the app. I will probably approve it (if I see it).
